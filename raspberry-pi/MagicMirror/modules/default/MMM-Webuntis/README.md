# MMM-Webuntis

A MagicMirror² module that shows cancelled, irregular or substituted lessons from WebUntis for configured students. It fetches timetable, exams and homework data from WebUntis and presents them in a compact list or a multi-day grid.

## BREAKING CHANGES in 0.4.0

This release consolidates several configuration keys and changes how the module handles config compatibility.

Important notes:

- The module contains a compatibility mapper that automatically translates several deprecated keys from older configs to the new key names during startup. By design, when a deprecated key is present its value will now take precedence — legacy values "win" and overwrite the new key. This makes upgrades safer for users who still have old keys in place, but you should still update your `config.js` to the canonical names.

Mapper behavior and warnings:

- When deprecated keys are detected the frontend emits a conspicuous browser console warning (styled in red) that lists the detected legacy keys and their location (e.g. `students[0].days`). This helps you find and update old keys during MagicMirror startup.
- Additionally, the backend will log an informational message for fetch operations; however, the compatibility mapping and the red console warning are produced in the frontend module so you can see them in the browser devtools when MagicMirror starts.

Common legacy → new mappings (applied automatically if present):

- `fetchInterval` → `fetchIntervalMs`
- `days` → `daysToShow`
- `examsDays` → `examsDaysAhead`
- `mergeGapMin` → `mergeGapMinutes`
- legacy `debug` / `enableDebug` (boolean) → `logLevel: 'debug'` or `'none'`
- `displaymode` → `displayMode` (normalized to lowercase)

Quick tip: find deprecated keys in your `config.js` with this command (run from your MagicMirror folder):

```bash
grep -n "fetchInterval\|days\|mergeGapMin\|displaymode\|enableDebug\|debug" config/config.js || true
```

Upgrade notes:

1. The mapper will translate legacy keys automatically at startup, but it's recommended to update your `config.js` to the new key names listed above.
2. Use the red console warning and the quick grep above to find legacy keys and replace them.
3. Restart MagicMirror after editing `config.js` to ensure the new keys are used consistently.

## Installation

1. Go to your MagicMirror² `modules` folder and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeikoGr/MMM-Webuntis
cd MMM-Webuntis
npm ci  --omit=dev
```

2. Add the module to your MagicMirror `config/config.js` (see example below).

## Update

To update to the latest version:

```bash
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Webuntis
git pull
npm ci --omit=dev
```

Restart MagicMirror after updating.

## Quick start

Add `MMM-Webuntis` to your `config/config.js` inside the `modules` array. The example below shows the most common global options and a minimal per-student credential configuration.

```javascript
{
    module: "MMM-Webuntis",
    position: "top_right",
    header: "Untis",
    config: {
        // global options
    logLevel: "debug",
        fetchIntervalMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
        daysToShow: 7,
        pastDaysToShow: 0,
        mergeGapMinutes: 15,

        // per-student credentials
        students: [
            { title: "Alice", qrcode: "untis://setschool?..." },
            { title: "Bob", qrcode: "untis://setschool?..." }
        ]
    }
},
```

Note: The option names listed here are the canonical names. A small compatibility mapper exists (see "BREAKING CHANGES" above) that will translate commonly-used legacy aliases during startup and print a console warning; however, you should still rename keys in your `config.js` to the canonical names for clarity and future compatibility.

## Configuration options

The following configuration options are supported. Global options can be declared at the top level of `config` and can be overridden per-student by adding the same property in a student object.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --: | --: | --- |
| `students` | array | required | Array of student credential objects (see below). |
| `header` | string | none | Optional title printed by MagicMirror for this module instance. |
| `daysToShow` | int | `7` | Number of upcoming days to fetch/display (0..10). Set to `0` to disable. Can be overridden in a student object. |
| `pastDaysToShow` | int | `0` | How many past days to include in the grid (useful for debugging). |
| `fetchIntervalMs` | int | `15 * 60 * 1000` | Fetch interval in milliseconds (default 15 minutes). |
| `mergeGapMinutes` | int | `15` | Allowed gap in minutes between consecutive lessons to consider them mergeable. Lower = stricter merging. |
| `showStartTime` | bool | `false` | When `true` show the lesson start time; when `false` show the lesson number (if available). |
| `useClassTimetable` | bool | `false` | Some schools only provide a class timetable; set `true` to request class timetable instead of the student timetable. |
| `showRegularLessons` | bool | `false` | Show regular lessons (not only substitutions/cancellations). |
| `showTeacherMode` | string | `'full'` | How to show teacher names: `'initial'` , `'full'` , `'none'`. |
| `useShortSubject` | bool | `false` | Use short subject names where available. |
| `showSubstitutionText` | bool | `false` | Show substitution text from WebUntis (if present). |
| `fetchHomeworks` | bool | `true` | When `false` skips homework API calls to save memory/CPU on low-RAM devices. |
| `examsDaysAhead` | int | `0` | How many days ahead to fetch exams. `0` disables exams. |
| `showExamSubject` | bool | `true` | Show subject for exams. |
| `showExamTeacher` | bool | `true` | Show teacher for exams. |
| `mode` | string | `'compact'` | Display mode for lists: `'verbose'` (per-student sections) or `'compact'` (combined). |
| `displayMode` | string | `'grid'` | How to display lessons: `'list'` or `'grid'` (multi-day grid with exact positioning). |
| `maxGridLessons` | int | `0` | Limit number of periods/timeUnits shown in grid view. `0` = show all. `>=1` is interpreted as the number of `timeUnits` (periods) to display starting from the first period; when `timeUnits` are not available the module falls back to a simple count-based limit. This option can be set globally or per-student. |
| `logLevel` | string | `'none'` | string to enable debugging: `'debug'`. |

### Student credential object

A single `students` entry is an object with credential and per-student overrides. Common fields:

- `title` (string) — displayed name for the student.
- `qrcode` (string) — preferred: QR-code login string from WebUntis (`untis://...`). If provided this is used for login.
- `school`, `username`, `password`, `server` — alternative credentials if QR code is not used.
- `class` — name of the class (used in anonymous/class mode).
- Per-student overrides: any global option (like `daysToShow`, `examsDaysAhead`, `logLevel`, `enableDebug`, etc.) can be supplied inside the student object to override the global value for that student.

Example student entry:

```javascript
{
  title: "Alice",
  qrcode: "untis://setschool?url=...&school=...&user=...&key=..."
  // optional override:
  // daysToShow: 3,
  // logLevel: 'debug'
}
```

## How the timetable grid works (developer notes)

- The backend (`node_helper.js`) fetches raw WebUntis data only. The frontend builds `timeUnits` from the timegrid and computes minute values from `startTime`/`endTime` strings when rendering.
- The frontend merges consecutive lessons with identical subject/teacher/code when the gap is within `mergeGapMinutes`. A merged block keeps a `lessonIds` array; `lessonId` is set when available.
- There is no explicit caching layer. Parallel fetches for the same credential are coalesced to avoid duplicate work.

Additional grid rendering notes:

- When `maxGridLessons` is set to `>=1` and `timeUnits` are available, the grid vertical range (time axis, hour lines and lesson blocks) is clipped to the end/start of the Nth `timeUnit` so periods below the cutoff are not shown. A small "... more" badge appears in the day's column when additional lessons are hidden.

## Log levels and debugging

- Use `logLevel` to control logging verbosity. For normal usage `info` or `none` is fine. Use `debug` for troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see empty results, check credentials and try `useClassTimetable: true` — some schools expose only class timetables.
- Enable `logLevel: 'debug'` to get more information in the MagicMirror server log.
- If a student uses MS365 or SSO logins that cannot be automated, prefer generating a WebUntis data-access QR code inside the student's account and use that value.
